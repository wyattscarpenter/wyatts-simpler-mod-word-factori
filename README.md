# Wyatt's Simpler Mod (for Word Factori)
<abbr title="Wyatt's Simpler Mod">WSM</abbr> is a [mod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modification) for the game [Word Factori](https://stargardengames.com/word-factori) that I (Wyatt) find aesthetically pleasing. Much simpler in possibility space than the original game. This probably means it's not as worth playing as the original game. But sometimes you can't get the muse of out of your head!

This game uses the official mod support for Word Factori, and does not introduce any new code. I ran into numerous minor bugs/crashes playing the original game, and so I expect WSM to suffer those too. Don't get discouraged! They are minor. Just exit and re-enter the game I guess. 

## How to install

By the time I'm done with this project, WSM should be available on the Steam Workshop and also through itch, like the rest of the mods.

You can also clone/download this repo and put it in the "mods" folder in the "word factori" folder that the game is in on your computer.

## How to play

The game should be adequately explained by the tips internally. Just go ahead and play it! You can select mods from the option menu.

## How to modiy

Read https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3069287778 or this project's [original_tips.json](original_tips.json) to learn how modding this game works. Then you can modify this mod. I don't think it need to be modified any further, but I have released my mod into the public domain in case you want to make your own based on it or whatever ü§∑. BTW, original_tips.json is the original example mod tips text, so it is NOT in the public domain and is the proprietary intellectual property of Star Garden Games (presumably).

## Graphetic note

This mod, like the original game, relies on the idea that a capital I is written as a straight line, up and down, much like |. In real life I think you should write it with crossbars, however, so as to distinguish it from other straight lines, like 1|lùç∑‚îÇ‚îÉ. ‚Äî The characters depicted in this game are fictious, and any similarity to real characters is entirely coincedental üòè
