  "Hello, and welcome to Wyatt's Simpler Mod! This is a mod for the game Word Factori that I (Wyatt) find aesthetically pleasing. Much simpler in possibility space than the original game. This probably means it's not as worth playing as the original game. But sometimes you can't get the muse of out of your head!",
  "This is the one and only tip! Please note that this mod does not use tri- or quad- mergers. Bend is also rarely used (although it is crucial). There are fewer special characters allowed in this mod than in the base game.",
